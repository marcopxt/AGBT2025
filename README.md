**Case 1**

The first set of simulations focused on a breeding program with two heterotic groups. The idea is two mimic a maize breeding breeeding program, with development of lines through doubled haploid production and the development of comercial hybrids created with combinations from the two heterotic groups. The simulations were conducted using AlphaSimR (Gaynor et al. 2021), as follows:

i. Base genome. The base genome was created following the maize settings in the *species* argument. A total of 300 QTLs per chromosome was simulated. 
ii. Trait.  A trait with 0.5 of heritability was simulated. Additive and domiance effects were assigned to the trait (being varDD and ddMean 0.2 and 0.92, respectively). 
iii. A breeding program was then simulated and a 15 years of burn-in was simulated. From here, all scenarios took place.

For more details on the simulation parameters, please, see Peixoto et al. (2024).

The second step was to implement the different scenarios for comparision. They were:
